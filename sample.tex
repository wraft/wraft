		\section{Introduction}
		
		We are a Digital Product Design company based out of Bangalore providing Product Design services for small and medium businesses. \newline
		
		With over 20 years of collective experience in building for the web - working with teams like Furlenco, Myntra, IDFC Bank, Cleartrip etc. We are passionate about partnering with small \& medium businesses in bringing best out of their products.
		
		\section{Problem Statement}
		As an online legal service provider, \newCommandCompanyName wants to re-position itself as an easy to use application for new and existings clients - there by increasing convertion and retention \\		
		
		\section{Our Design Process}
		
		Our Product Design approach is a combination of Lean UX principles, and Google Design Sprint, resulting in quick outcomes, and faster validations.\newline
		
		Our design process is split into 3 major parts:
		
		\subsection{Discovery}
		Discovery involves conducting inquiry into types of potential users of
		the application. This involves Strategic Analysis and Planning,
		Information Architecture, Interaction with potential users and business
		owners, doing a competitive analysis of the product landscape, talking
		with stake owners to understand business objectives etc.
		
		This includes, but not limited to following activities
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
			\item
			\textbf{User Research}: We will hold discussions\_interviews
			with business stakeholders and other relevant business user groups to
			clarify the business goals and identify supplemental user information. While also researching into various aspects of the users that we intent to cater.
			\item
			\textbf{Competitive Analysis}: We will review competitor apps to
			identify where LawStore needs to be positioned within the competitive
			landscape, work with the team to identify likes, dislikes, and opportunities in the space.
			\item
			\textbf{Persona Development}: Personas are documents that describe
			typical target users that helps making business decision easier. This is mostly derived out of talking with different sets of users of the application, or on a hypothetical basis.
		\end{enumerate}
	
		\subsection{Define \& Prototype}
		Based on the discovery, a usable interactive prototype of the
		application will be developed in close collaboration with LawStore. This
		enables both parties to put in thoughts and test practical implications
		and users perspective of the application. We'll test the applications
		flow, and usability in different aspects. This includes, but are not
		limited to following activities:
		
		\begin{enumerate}
		\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
		\item
		\textbf{User Journey Maps:} A time-line of user actions that describes
		the relationship between your brand and your customers. We will
		visualise all of a user's interactions with your product, from their
		point of view.
		\item
		\textbf{Information Architecture:} With use of methods like Card
		Sorting, we will organise and prioritise contents within the
		application, making it easier for users to find relevant content.
		\item
		\textbf{Wireframes \& Prototype:} We believe in early prototyping, and validating
		our assumptions from real users, with prototyping, we will have
		realistic understanding of how our users would interact with your
		application.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\subsection{Design and Validate}
		
		This phase involves building a fully functional design system, Business
		owners and potential users are given this to test our interactions and
		the feed backs are validated, and applied on the next iteration.
		
		\begin{enumerate}
		\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
		\item
		\textbf{Identity:} Forming a strong, memorable narrative is critical
		for thriving businesses. Our process begins by defining the characteristics of the brand, and then building visuals around the defined characterists.
		\item
		\textbf{Visual Design} Based on defined characteristics of the brand, we will come up with different set of designs to put them into practice. To make design persistent - we build a system to bring in continuely - mostly through a set of scales for typopgraphy, spacing, and coloring. Our deliverable will include reusable, components, that makes future product design faster, and maintainable.
		\item
		\textbf{Usability Testing:} We will organise a set of potential users
		interact with the app, and take their inputs/feedbacks, also record
		their experiences.
		\end{enumerate}
		
	
		\section{ Additional Services}
		
		\subsection{ Branding}
		We strongly believe that any effective design project should start with a definition of what it should be and what it should not be
		
		Rebranding will help LawStore to identity, and define characteristics of the brand, and build a strong and consistent visual narratives for the brand - helping brand achieve trust, and instil promise to the user.
		
		The development of this brand will be essential to consistently delivering the right message to the right people to create just the right reaction.
		
		\subsection{Design Conversion to Code}
		It is bad when design get lost in translation - as Product Designers who have hands-on experience with technology, our team can ensure design and its code are exactly the same.
		
		We build design components based on the Atomic Design principle, where every elements are classified as Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, and Pages - each of which are independent that can be composed to form any types of page structures, that  acts as source of truth for future development, as well as living style guide for the product.
